Report link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/11NEw4dDKDKuAeOLAbDk6M7vS_6RJAQVH4cQDUTDCzXk/edit?usp=sharing

Project objectives:
This project aims to create a machine-learning model that predicts the most optimal fifth player for the home team in an NBA game.  This machine learning model should take in the partial lineup data and other game-related features to maximize the team's overall performance in the game.


Instructions for setting up and running the code.
After cloning the repo, with just the code files and the raw data files:
1- Run “clean_nba_data.py”
2- Run “create_dictionary.py”
3- Run “prepare_train_data.py”
4- Run “train_sgboost.py”
5- Run “prepare_test_data.py”
6- Run “predict_xgboost.py”
7- Run “compare_predictions.py”




An overview of the results.
First attempt: 0%
Second attempt: 3%
